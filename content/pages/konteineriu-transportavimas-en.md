  description: "Cargo transportation is an important part of the logistics
    process, regardless of what products or goods, and perhaps even chemical or
    flammable materials, are transported. Business is successful when customers
    and employees are satisfied, so the quality, safety and speed of services
    are very important to us. Container transport is a very popular and common
    service, as the same containers can often be used for both water and land
    transport. As much as 90% of cargo (excluding liquid and bulk) is
    transported in containers. Container transport of goods often takes place by
    ship or rail, as well as by truck. There are a total of 5 container
    standards: 20 feet (6.1 m), 40 (12.2 m), 45 (13.7 m, 48 (14.6 m), 53 (16.2
    m)."
